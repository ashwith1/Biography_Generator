Here is the revised biography:

Johanna Lascavi was born on 22 December 1918 in Gelsenkirchen. Her parents were Friedrich Lascavi and his wife, who came from East Prussia. Johanna was the first child in the family, followed by three other siblings. Her father was a politically active man who campaigned for workers' rights. He was a member of the metalworkers' union and was involved in various political organisations.

Johanna attended the Free School in Gelsenkirchen, which was financed by the city. She was one of the first pupils to attend the school and remembers the time as very positive. After school, she began training as a chef in a hospital, but had to drop out due to health problems.

In 1940, Johanna began working at Mannesmann Röhrenwerke Consol, where she was employed in the Hollerith department. She worked there until 1942, when she was conscripted and sent to Mogilev in the Soviet Union. There she worked in the sutlery and telephone switchboard.

After her return from the Soviet Union, Johanna worked at the NSV in Brake, where she did clerical work. She was also responsible for the distribution of requisitioned goods. In 1945, she underwent an operation to remove a tumour and had to spend several months in hospital afterwards.

After the war, Johanna returned to Gelsenkirchen and began working at Feilgenhauer, where she made aprons at home. She worked there until 1949, when her husband returned from being a prisoner of war. In 1950, her son Paul was born and she had to give up her job to look after him.

Johanna and her husband moved into a new house in Gelsenkirchen in 1957, which they had been given by the city. They were very proud of their new home and endeavoured to build a good neighbourhood. Unfortunately, however, relations with the neighbours did not develop as well as they had hoped.
