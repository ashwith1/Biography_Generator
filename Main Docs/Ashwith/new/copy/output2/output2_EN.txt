Sending to API: I was the first grandchild, the only grandchild, for a long time and I was very spoiled because I spent a lot of time with my grandmother. I was born in Hemer in the Sauerland and was born on May 29th, 1925. And, yes, my childhood was actually normal, although I suffered quite a bit from migraines as a preschooler, which got worse and worse during school. I would have liked to go to high school, but I wasn't allowed to because I was always told I was sick. I got my secondary school certificate in 1939. And back then, the compulsory year or financial year, eh, had to be..., had to be done, whether you went to school, er, or before you could start a job, like that. And because my grandparents were quite, let's say, a little arrogant, I wasn't allowed to live in a single household, like the usual

Sending to API: But I don't know. And that was just how it was, this farm was converted into a labor service camp. Yes, and I have to say, I felt very comfortable there, even though I was spoiled and really didn't have to shine my shoes or make a sandwich or anything like that at home. So, when I had wishes, I got what I wanted. And that's where I learned to work. I learned to share, but that actually already during the country year. The country year was actually even harder than the labor service in '39. During the country year we had about, I think, 70 of us there, whereas during the labor service I think there were only about 35 to 40 of us, so a very small group. And I have to be honest and say, that was very nice. Just the smaller group. Yes...
The daily routine, yes, waking up, like in the past in the country year, we were woken up at 6 a.m., in winter at 7 a.m., and then
API Response:
Sending to API: Yes, and then later we were deployed in, we went to households, to households with many children, where the men were in the fields, where they had moved in. We had to help the women. Look after the children. Or to the farmer, where the sons or men had moved in, where the winter work had to be done, because the farmer also has a lot to do. And, I have to say quite honestly, I really learned what I needed to live in the country year and in the labor service. And I don't know if I would have managed life as well as I did if I had stayed at home. Because it really wasn't easy for me. After the labor service...
Yes, we had to cycle, let's say, to the next village, to Allagen, to Belecke. So in the immediate vicinity, right. Either on foot or by bike. We had bicycles. And
API Response:
Sending to API: We also had enough time out that we had a Sunday off and then we could drive to Soest or to Warstein in the surrounding..., er, you could meet someone there if you wanted. We could get as much mail as we wanted. But no male visitors were tolerated in the camp itself, right. So there really wasn't any. The political lessons, yes, they were tailored to the time. Right? I mean, we didn't have any exaggerated ones. They were of course focused on National Socialism, right. But, as I said, we were lucky that we didn't have any fanatics. Old history that we had already learned at school was also refreshed. For example, the "Old Fritz", Queen Louise. Of course, the people who were taken were those who, let's say, were seen as ideals or role models.
API Response:
Sending to API: Yes, and in the evenings, after dinner, we spent another hour downstairs. And then of course they went to bed. And they only went out together. They were between 12 and 14. So the last two years of school. [speaks in parallel] Mmh, I'd say there were a lot of... wait a minute, there were 1, 2, 3, many, 5, 6, 7, 7 or 8 bedrooms, so I'd say there were about 70 to 80 girls. Only girls. Yes, yes. With the whole bubble. I got another one later. For a long time I was alone with that. And we had a Red Cross nurse who always went with us when we went out, right? She was, er, also trained to help out. Yes, and, well, that was very nice. And then I went to..., er, I can't remember now [browsing] how long was the work service...? Wait a minute (???)...
That lasted until October 43
API Response:
Sending to API: But then we went afterwards..., we thought, oh man, we'll try it, we could, we didn't want to get people into trouble. Oh no, and as we wanted to go into the yard, my husband went first, I pushed the stroller behind, then someone tapped me on the shoulder from behind, I turned around it was a Russian. All I could say to my husband was Kurt and I was speechless. And he turned around and turned pale. Now it was... the Russian understood a little German and my husband knew a little Russian. And then he wanted to know what we wanted. And then we said we wanted to go home. Where was our home? So we told him we wanted to go to Gelsenkirchen-Buer. And then he looked in the pram and then he made it plausible to us that he would be relieved in half an hour and by then we would have to

Sending to API: My grandparents had a house. We used to live there and they all moved in together. But there wasn't enough space for me to go there with my two children, right? Well, I mean, you benefited from the labor service, the year in the country. What tricks did we learn there and in... let's say, in the year of service, not so much. In '39 you still had almost everything. But in the labor service, everything was rationed. You had to make do with what you had. I guess I was lucky after the war in that I had the normal food stamps for my husband, for myself. And then I had an infant card, then I got a mother's card. And my husband also had the war-disabled allowance. So I drank five liters of milk almost every day.

Sending to API: I then got married again. And then I was self-employed for a while. Er, wait a minute, 49, 54, October 54. Yes, then came Ina and Andrea. Ina was born in '54 and Andrea was born in '59. Not by the second husband. And, at first I was really unhappy about Andrea. Today I'm glad I have them. The best horse in the stable. Really. My eldest isn't bad either. My eldest is a bit unlucky. She fell...
Oh, the thing is over. Is it working? Well, stop it then. [x]
First of all I had a small lending library. And that was around '54, '59, so around 1958 I first had a small lending library. That worked quite well. Stationery, cigarettes. And the children were then..., the eldest went on an apprenticeship, he trained at the post office, to be a telecommunications technician. And the second one later went to Ford Fisch

Sending to API: I've just heard that it's 313 marks so far. [emphasizes] The country year. The country year camp, which counts as a compulsory year. That wasn't recognized. That means that it was service to the people. The household, if I had been in a private job, would have been recognized. Although we had to work much harder. Because those who were in the household were also allowed to go home. They had their free time. We were [emphasized] always under control, right, we were always only in the camp. We were always under supervision, right. And they could go home anyway. They were mostly housed in the local area. In the same place as those who worked in the household, right. I mean, there were also some who were perhaps a little further away, I don't know. [x][short interruption]
Yes, I'm saying that through the country year and the labor service we got
